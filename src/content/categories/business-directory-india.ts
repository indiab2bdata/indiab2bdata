    answer:
      "A business directory lists companies organised by industry, city and category so buyers, sellers and marketers can discover the right businesses quickly. IndiaB2BData.com's directory-style database covers 500+ categories across 700+ Indian cities, filterable before you export a single record.",
    intro: [
      "Unlike a static online directory you browse one listing at a time, ours is built to be filtered and exported in bulk - pick your industry category and city, and get a ready-to-use contact list instead of scrolling through pages of listings.",
      "It works well both ways: find suppliers and vendors in a category you need, or build a targeted local list of companies to reach with your own product or service.",
